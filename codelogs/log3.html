        <h2>CSS Media Queries?</h2>
        <p>
            A CSS media query lets developers change CSS styles depending on the screen size, orientation, or device
            type. It works by checking the screen conditions and applying styles only when those conditions are true.
            Media queries are useful because they help websites look better on different devices like phones, tablets,
            laptops, and desktops.

        <h3> width (min-width / max-width)</h3>
        <p>
            The width media feature checks how wide the viewport is.
            It is usually used with min-width or max-width to change styles
            based on screen size. This is common for responsive layouts.
        </p>



        <h3> height (min-height / max-height)</h3>

        <p>
            The height feature checks how tall the viewport is.
            It works like width, but focuses on vertical space.
            This can be useful for full-screen layouts.
        </p>


        <h3> aspect-ratio</h3>

        <p>
            The aspect-ratio feature checks the relationship between
            the width and height of the viewport. It helps adjust layouts
            for very wide or very tall screens.

        </p>

        <h3>orientation</h3>

        <p>
            The orientation feature checks if the device is in portrait
            or landscape mode. This is useful when users rotate their
            phones or tablets.
        </p>
