    <h1>Code Log 2: CSS Measuring Units</h1>
    <hr>
    <h2> What is the difference between absolute and relative CSS length units?</h2>
        <p>
            In CSS, absolute units and relative units are different in how they define size. Absolute units have a fixed and exact size, and they do not depend on other elements or the screen size. 
            Because of this, they remain consistent and do not change automatically. <br> In contrast, relative units are based on another value, such as a parent element, the root element, or the viewport size. 
            This means their size can change depending on the context.
        </p>

    <h3> px, pt</h3>
        <p>
            The unit <strong>px</strong> stands for <strong>pixels</strong>. It is commonly used in web design and represents a fixed unit on the screen. It is considered an absolute unit because it does not depend on other elements.<br> 
            The unit <strong>pt</strong> stands for <strong>points</strong> and is mostly used in print design. One point equals 1/72 of an inch. While px is more common for screens, pt is more common for printed materials.
        </p>
    


    <h3> vmax, vmin</h3>

        <p>
            The unit <strong>vmax</strong> stands for <strong>viewport maximum</strong>. It is a relative unit based on the viewport size. 1vmax equals 1% of the larger value between the viewport width and height. 
            It scales according to the larger dimension of the screen.<br>
            The unit <strong>vmin</strong> stands for <strong>viewport minimum</strong>. It is also a relative unit based on the viewport size. 1vmin equals 1% of the smaller value between the viewport width and height. 
            It scales according to the smaller dimension of the screen.
        </p>


    <h3> in, pc</h3>

        <p>
            The unit <strong>in</strong> stands for <strong>inches</strong> and is an absolute unit based on physical measurement. 
            It is mostly used for print layouts. <br> The unit <strong>pc</strong> stands for <strong>picas</strong>, and 1 pica equals 1/6th of an inch. Like inches, picas are also more common in print design rather than web design. 
            These units are precise but not commonly used for responsive layouts.
