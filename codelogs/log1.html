    <h1>Code Log 1: HTML Semantic Tags</h1>
    <hr>
    <h2> What is the difference between non-semantic and semantic tags in HTML?</h2>
        <p>
            Non-semantic tags do not explain the meaning of the content they contain. 
            Tags like  &lt;div&gt; and &lt;span&gt; are generic containers that are mainly used for grouping elements or applying styles. 
            When using non-semantic tags, it can be difficult to understand what the content is for just by looking at the HTML structure.
        </p>
    
        <p>
            Semantic tags clearly describe the purpose of the content. 
            Tags such as &lt;header&gt;, &lt;nav&gt;, &lt;article&gt;, and &lt;footer&gt; show the role of each part of the webpage. 
            Because of this, the overall structure of the page becomes easier to understand for developers, browsers, and assistive technologies.
        </p>
    <h2> What are two (or more) benefits of using semantic tags?</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>Lists</li>
        <li>Tables</li>
        <li>Headlines like h1, h2, etc.</li>
        <li>Paragraphs</li>
        <li>Any other HTML tags</li>


    </ul>
    <p>You can also add as much CSS as you want. Or as little. It's up to you.</p>
    <p>Finally, if you want to simulate the apperance of a tag, use the <code>&lt;</code> and <code>&gt;</code> characters</p>
