    <h1>Code Log 1: HTML Semantic Tags</h1>
    <hr>
    <h2> What is the difference between non-semantic and semantic tags in HTML?</h2>
        <p>
            Non-semantic tags do not explain the meaning of the content they contain. 
            Tags like  &lt;div&gt; and &lt;span&gt; are generic containers that are mainly used for grouping elements or applying styles. 
            When using non-semantic tags, it can be difficult to understand what the content is for just by looking at the HTML structure.
        </p>
    
        <p>
            Semantic tags clearly describe the purpose of the content. 
            Tags such as &lt;header&gt;, &lt;nav&gt;, &lt;article&gt;, and &lt;footer&gt; show the role of each part of the webpage. 
            Because of this, the overall structure of the page becomes easier to understand for developers, browsers, and assistive technologies.
        </p>


    <h2> What are two (or more) benefits of using semantic tags?</h2>

        <p>
            Using semantic tags provides important benefits for both users and developers.
            They make the structure of a webpage clearer, which helps with navigation,
            maintenance, and compatibility with assistive technologies.
        </p>


    <ul>
        <li><strong>Accessibility:</strong> Semantic tags help screen readers understand the structure of the page,so users with disabilities can navigate the website more easily.</li>
        <li><strong>SEO:</strong> Search engines can better understand the content and purpose of the webpage, which can help improve search rankings.</li>
        <li><strong>Readability:</strong> The HTML code is easier to read and understand for developers, especially when working on large projects.</li>
        


    </ul>
    <p>You can also add as much CSS as you want. Or as little. It's up to you.</p>
    <p>Finally, if you want to simulate the apperance of a tag, use the <code>&lt;</code> and <code>&gt;</code> characters</p>
